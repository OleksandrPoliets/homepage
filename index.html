                I'm a scientist; because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, 
                and when I don't like something about the world, I change it.

          <h2 class="section-header">My Biography</h2>
          <p class="biography-paragraph">
            I was born on July 3, 1958 in Guanabacoa, Cuba as Ricardo León Sánchez de Reinaldo. I'm married to Suzanne Sanchez.
            5150 would be the IQ score for me from Dimension C-137.
          </p>
          <p class="biography-paragraph">
            I am a genius scientist, capable of creating complex scientific inventions, including brain-enhancing helmets, dream-invading devices, portals to
            several different dimensions, various energy weapons and force fields, and the world's first amusement park inside the body of a living human. 
            My brilliance can be muddled by my jaded personal views and his alcoholic tendencies. I am easily bored and do not do well with routine. 
            I regularly go to other dimensions to harvest resources and will often willingly kill aliens to get them. I am willing to be extremely brutal such as when 
            people betray me or my life or those close to me are in danger. I am usually portrayed as homicidal and having a large disregard for life, enough that 
            I came close to bombing the world with neutrinos while drunk.
          </p>
          <p class="biography-paragraph">
            This does not make me completely heartless, because I was startled or annoyed by the loss of life that I deem unnecessary, foolish, or unreasonable. 
            I also was shocked and upset by people I was close to dying or nearly dying.
          </p>
          <p class="biography-paragraph">
            Contrary to popular belief, I am not a nihilist. 
            Although my commonly-stated viewpoint on life may be the typical nihilistic idealism that "nothing has meaning", 
            I don't always put my money where his mouth is. I care about maintaining relationships with others and holds the sentimental value of my family.
          </p>
          <p class="biography-paragraph">
            I tend to dislike people with authority and government officials. I refuse to join the Council of Ricks, because he views them as a government. 
            I also call the guards at Intergalactic Customs "robots" and claims that I don't respect them, as 
            I deem them bureaucrats and don't like "being told where to go and what to do". I also have a great dislike of standardized education, claiming that school "isn't a 
            place for smart people" and a "waste of time", and insists that things such as studying and homework are pointless and stupid.

                  I made a dysfunctional love potion that spread a flu-like virus to everyone in the world, which I tried to fix
                  by making another virus including praying mantis DNA that caused them to rip apart and mutate into giant praying mantis monsters. 
                  I  attempted to fix this, by using another potion, but this only made them mutate again, cronenberging the entire world. 
                  I couldn't fix the mutations in the end, and just left the dimension with Morty (my grandson), leaving all of the mutated humans behind.

                  I take Morty along with me on all of my adventures. I often endangers my life as well as leaving me traumatized and mentally 
                  scarred by exposing myself to scary and horrible things, such as watching myself get killed and having to bury my own body or 
                  being forced to kill clones of my family.

                  Through the course of my adventures, many people have died as a direct or indirect result of my actions. 
                  These deaths were usually during the commission of various other serious crimes I was committing, including felony evasion, smuggling, fraud, etc. 
                  I have also induced Morty to kill people for him, such as making me shoot the security guards.
